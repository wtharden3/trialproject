    <pre>we need a new page with private info</pre>
    <pre> From the public meeting page, a visiting user should be able to enter in an arbitrary email address, name, and an RSVP of "Yes", "No', or "Maybe" (inside Boardable this would obviously require authentication, but any name/email will do for now)</pre>
    <h1>{{$meeting->title}}</h1>

    <div>{{$meeting->description}}</div>
    <div>{{$meeting->location}}</div>
    <div>{{$meeting->start->format('Y M d @ H:i')}} - {{$meeting->end->format('Y M d @ H:i')}}</div>

    <!-- here is where a form allowing users to toggle on/off the public meeting page - you will need to handle that form inside of a controller -->

    <h2>RSVPs</h2>
    <!-- here is where a list of emails with their RSVP status for this meeting will go -->
